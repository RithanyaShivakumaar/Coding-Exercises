# Coding-Exercises
This repository contains solutions for two coding exercises focused on design patterns and a mini-project. The first exercise demonstrates six use cases across behavioral, creational, and structural design patterns. The second exercise implements a console-based Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer, using Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns.
